Step 1:- Solder the ir as per the image uploaded and make the connection for the ir sensor to Arduino uno analog pin.

Step 2:- By using the Arduino IDE, Connect the Arduino uno model to comport of pc using the Arduino uno connector and upload the code(burn) to Arduino

Step 3:- For creating the goggle, I had made use of normal ir sensor but it is not safe,in case for usage of prolonging time period use, try to use any ir led that operated above 960nm.

Step 4:- Create a java project in eclipse with java class as RobotExp and copy paste the code from JavaAppliactionCode folder.

Step 5:- Connect the Arduino uno to the computer and run the java code in eclipse ide hope this helps
